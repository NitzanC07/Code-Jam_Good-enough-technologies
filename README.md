# Code Jam project : Study Buddy.

## About:
This project was made as part of the October 2021 code jam hosted by Practicum international.
We made a website called StudyBuddy that should help likeminded individuals who want to learn a new skill to team up so they can learn and work together.

## Into:
During pandemic many people started to think about their career and education. Many of us started to learn new profession, and we probably will think about this time as about time of learning. For financial reasons and because we are having more time, because we stay at home more and can study online.
But we need people. For many of us, it was hard to find new colleagues and people with same professional interests. We know how useful communities now, but sometimes we need something more personal, less distanced. To motivate each other, ask for advice, to discuss new skills, profession and exchange experience. Learning is still hard, and we need support from people in similar situation. Or maybe we need somebody to collaborate with?

That’s why we decided to create a website for searching a companion for learning. It’s like a tinder for students. We have many dating apps, but we need the same format for ambitious and career-oriented people.
And StudyBuddy was born.

Because of limited time and our limited skills, the MVP looks like a one-page website, where you can see many profiles. User can filter results by city, by learning interests and by their level. And communicate in chat. Video calls are also possible.

In future, we can make the app, add more filters, with more personalized results, develop it as social media. And create materials for better study - articles, events, groups, communities. And help people to build new professional connections and help each other to learn new skills.
